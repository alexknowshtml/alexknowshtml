# Hi, I'm Alex Hillman

**Philadelphia** | **Coworking Pioneer, Community & Business Builder, Recovering Developer** | **Building [JFDI Bot](https://jfdi.bot)**

I founded [Indy Hall](https://indyhall.org), one of the world's longest-running coworking communities (est 2006). 

I co-founded Stacking the Bricks, where we've helped thousands of students learn to [finish the projects they start](https://stackingthebricks.com/just-fucking-ship/), ship products [people want to buy](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy-video/), and [make better business decisions with the long-view in mind](https://tiny.mba). 

Now I'm building JFDIBot — my digital chief of staff powered by Claude Code — and open-sourcing the tools and lessons that come out of that process.

## The JFDIBot Project - aka Andy

Andy is my custom-tailored AI chief of staff — built on Claude Code, running on my own infrastructure, managing my calendar, email, relationships, projects, and more. 

[JFDI Bot](https://jfdi.bot) is the version that I custom tailor for other business owners as a hands-on concierge service + business owner community. I also publish articles about my lessons learned and new releases there. 

The [Andy Timeline](https://github.com/alexknowshtml/andy-timeline) documents the full build of Andy in public, week by week.
