# Hi, I'm Alex Hillman

**Philadelphia** | **Coworking pioneer** | **Building [JFDI Bot](https://jfdi.bot)**

I founded [Indy Hall](https://indyhall.org), one of the world's longest-running coworking communities (18+ years). Now I'm building Andy — a custom AI chief of staff powered by Claude Code — and open-sourcing the tools that come out of that process.

> I don't build AI tools. I build a business with AI, and release the parts that might help you do the same.

## The Andy Project

Andy is my custom-tailored AI chief of staff — built on Claude Code, running on my own infrastructure, managing my calendar, email, relationships, and projects. [JFDI Bot](https://jfdi.bot) is the productized version.

The [Andy Timeline](https://github.com/alexknowshtml/andy-timeline) documents the full build in public, week by week.
